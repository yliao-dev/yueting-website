    description: `This project is a fully responsive personal website that built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and deployed through Vercel with my custom domain. It combines clean design with thoughtful structure, showcasing my projects, photography collections, and blog posts.
                  
    Key features:
    • Smooth animations and intuitive navigation
    • Performance-optimized gallery with WebP images and metadata-driven layout logic
    • Modular content management using JSON and Markdown
    • Consistently optimized Lighthouse scores

    The site was developed over 3 full weeks and represents my first personal website project—a milestone that reflects both my coding skills and UI/UX. What started on scratch paper became a personal canvas — a clean, responsive space that reflects how I think and build.`,
