## 🖼️ Image Workflow

Images are optimized via custom Node scripts leveraging Sharp:

1. **Export Images**

   Export images from CaptureOne (or other photo editing software) as JPEG.

2. **Folder Preparation**

   - Create a folder named `source` containing all images for import.
   - Move the `source` folder into the relevant subdirectory under `public/images/`.  
     Example:
     ```
     public/images/gallery/collection1/source/
     ```

3. **Run Optimization Scripts**

   Use scripts provided in `./scripts`. See instructions below under [Running Image Script](#running-image-script).

4. **Resulting `.webp` Image Specifications:**

| Type            | Width  | Quality     | Target Size |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Gallery Preview | 1600px | 80–90% JPEG | 300–500 KB  |
| Thumbnail/Grid  | 600px  | 80% JPEG    | 100–150 KB  |

---

## Running Image Script

Example: adding images to the Gallery page.

1. From the repository root, run:

   ```bash
   npm run images-update gallery
   ```

2. This executes two scripts:

   - `process-images-rename.js`: Renames images sequentially.
   - `process-images-reformat.js`: Converts and resizes images to WebP.

3. Images located under `public/images/gallery/` are processed, resulting in filenames like `001.webp`, `002.webp`, etc.

4. Optimized images are output to:

   ```
   public/images/gallery/collection1/
   ├── preview/    # WebP images, 1600px width
   ├── thumbnail/  # WebP images, 600px width
   └── source/     # Original JPEG images (can be deleted post-processing)
   ```

5. After successful processing, safely delete the original `source` folder before deployment.

6. Advanced configurations are adjustable via:
   - `./scripts/images-config.json`
   - Direct edits to script files in `./scripts/`
